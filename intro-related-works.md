## Introduction


## Related Works
There has been other work done by researchers involving machine learning and Twitter, specifically with a focus on politicians. We describe several closely related works as follows, and then we note how our research differs from others’ works. A University of Michigan and Georgia Tech [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11162.pdf) from 2018 focuses on classifying Russian trolls vs. “normal”/control accounts on Twitter. They pay particular attention to Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. Election, and create a machine learning model to correctly predict Russian troll accounts from non-troll accounts with high accuracy. This paper, unlike ours, does not address American politicians specifically or make any distinctions between Republicans and Democrats. Another [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04291.pdf), from USC researchers and presented at WWW in 2018, addresses misinformation. In this paper, the researchers used machine learning techniques to “investigate the role and effects of misinformation, using the content produced by Russian Trolls on Twitter as a proxy for misinformation.” They specifically looked at both liberal and conservative media outlets, and particularly focused on “users who re-shared the posts produced on Twitter by the Russian troll accounts publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress investigation” of 2016 election interference. This paper does not focus on actual politicians’ tweets but instead focuses on private citizen retweets; we will focus on the tweets of politicians. An additional [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244019827715), from NYU and published in 2019, uses neural networks to classify tweets from Russian accounts as being pro-regime, anti-regime, or neutral. Specifically, the researchers used a “deep feedforward neural network (multilayer perceptron or MLP) that uses a wide range of textual features including words, word pairs, links, mentions, and hashtags to separate four contextually relevant types of bots: pro-Kremlin, neutral/other, pro-opposition, and pro-Kiev.” The results were “high-confidence predictions for most observations”. This paper focuses on only Russian accounts and does not investigate American politicians, compared to our work which concentrates on Russian-produced tweets that relate to events in United States politics as well as American politicians. Finally, a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04289.pdf) from 2018 involving researchers from USC and the Indian Institute of Technology uses neural networks with a contextual long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture that looks at both content and metadata from Twitter accounts to identify bots among real human users. The authors also used synthetic minority oversampling in order to create a large dataset for training. Our paper will address a similar issue involving classification of bot tweets versus real human user tweets, but with a focus on political speech involving Russian bots and American Democrat and Republican politicians.
